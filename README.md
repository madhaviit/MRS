  MUSIC RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
</h1>

A hybrid music recommender system which uses content-based filtering coupled with collaborative-based filtering to provide a personalised music listening session for a user. Our pipeline incorporates K-Mean clustering algorithm and a Matrix Factorisation-based model to predict the likelihood of the songs the user would like to listen to based on his previous listening sessions and music taste.
